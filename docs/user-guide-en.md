## Installation & Launch

### System Requirements

- Windows 10/11 64-bit
- [.NET 8 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/latest/runtime)
- [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) (usually pre-installed on Windows 10/11)

### Installation Steps

All data is stored in the `User/` folder relative to the executable:
